# One is enough: Client-Wise Targeted Backdoor in Federated Learning

This repository contains the code for the submited paper *One is enough: Client-Wise Targeted Backdoor in Federated Learning* submited to ESORICS 2022.
The repository also contains extra experimentetion, which can be found under the directory [experiments](./experiments/). Figures are also included in the repository under the directory [figures](./figures/).

## Run

For the shake of reproducibility, the code can be run just executing the [notebook](One_is_enough.ipynb). Similarly, the notebook is anotated in the same way as the paper sections, so it is easy to follow.

## Aditional experiments

Raw data for the experiments can be found under the directory [experiments/data](.experiments/data/). As a summary of those experiments, the figures in the directory [figures](./figures/) were created.
